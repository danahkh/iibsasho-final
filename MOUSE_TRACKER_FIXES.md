## Mouse Tracker Assertion Error - FIXES APPLIED

### ðŸŽ¯ Root Cause Analysis:
The mouse tracker assertion errors were caused by:
1. **Rapid widget rebuilds** without proper keys causing Flutter to lose track of widget identity
2. **setState() calls during build cycles** causing infinite rebuilding loops
3. **Mouse hover events** triggering rebuilds on widgets that were being disposed/recreated
4. **Image loading** causing unnecessary rebuilds during network operations

### âœ… Fixes Applied:

#### 1. **Added Widget Keys**
- **ListingCard**: `key: ValueKey('listing_${listing.id}_${index}')`
- **Category Items**: `key: ValueKey('category_${cat.id}_$index')`
- **Subcategory Items**: `key: ValueKey('subcat_${subcat.id}_$index')`
- **Impact**: Flutter can properly track widget identity during rebuilds

#### 2. **Debounce Mechanism**
- Added `Timer? _debounceTimer` to prevent rapid successive filter calls
- `_filterListings()` now waits 100ms before executing filtering
- Prevents mouse hover/tap spam from causing rapid setState calls
- **Impact**: Eliminates rapid-fire rebuilding

#### 3. **State Management Improvements**
- Added loading state checks (`if (_isLoading) return;`) to prevent operations during loading
- Added `mounted` checks before calling setState
- Separated `_filterListings()` into debounced and actual filtering methods
- **Impact**: Prevents setState calls on unmounted widgets

#### 4. **Better Image Loading**
- Added `loadingBuilder` to Image.network widgets
- Added error logging for debugging
- Prevents image loading from triggering unnecessary rebuilds
- **Impact**: Stable image display without render issues

#### 5. **Navigation Safety**
- Added try-catch blocks around navigation calls
- Added error handling for listing detail navigation
- **Impact**: Prevents navigation errors from causing rebuilding issues

#### 6. **Timer Cleanup**
- Added `_debounceTimer?.cancel()` to dispose method
- Proper cleanup prevents memory leaks and orphaned timers
- **Impact**: Clean app lifecycle management

### ðŸ›  Technical Details:

**Before**: Widget rebuilds were happening faster than Flutter could track them, causing the mouse tracker to lose sync with widget positions.

**After**: Widgets have stable identities (keys), operations are debounced, and state changes are properly managed.

### ðŸ“± Expected Results:
- âœ… No more mouse tracker assertion errors
- âœ… Smooth scrolling and interaction
- âœ… Stable widget rendering
- âœ… Responsive category/subcategory selection
- âœ… Proper image loading without flicker
- âœ… Stable navigation without freezing

### ðŸ§ª Test Steps:
1. **Launch app** - should load without console errors
2. **Hover over listings** - no assertion errors
3. **Tap categories rapidly** - smooth transitions
4. **Scroll up/down** - no rendering issues
5. **Navigate to listing details** - stable navigation

The mouse tracker assertion errors should now be completely resolved!
