## Critical Rendering Issues Fixed

### Problems Identified & Fixed:

#### 1. ✅ **Duplicate Assignment Bug**
- **Issue**: Line 60 had `_allListings = listings;` twice
- **Fix**: Removed duplicate assignment
- **Impact**: Prevented memory issues and potential loops

#### 2. ✅ **Infinite Rendering Loop** 
- **Issue**: `_refreshListings()` was calling `_filterListings()` which called `setState()` infinitely
- **Fix**: Modified `_refreshListings()` to handle filtering without setState when applying filters
- **Impact**: App should no longer become unresponsive

#### 3. ✅ **ListView Constraint Issues**
- **Issue**: Multiple scrollable widgets causing assertion errors
- **Fix**: Changed physics from `AlwaysScrollableScrollPhysics` to `NeverScrollableScrollPhysics` for the nested ListView
- **Impact**: Should resolve the box constraint assertion errors

#### 4. ✅ **Circular setState Calls**
- **Issue**: Multiple methods triggering setState in loops
- **Fix**: Separated database loading from filtering logic
- **Impact**: Cleaner state management

### Key Changes Made:

1. **home_page.dart**: 
   - Fixed duplicate assignment in `_loadAllListings()`
   - Modified `_refreshListings()` to avoid circular setState calls
   - Added proper ListView physics constraints
   - Added debug logging for tap events
   - Separated refresh logic from filter logic

2. **Better Error Handling**:
   - Retry buttons now call `_loadAllListings()` instead of `_refreshListings()`
   - Clear filters now loads fresh data instead of filtering empty cache

### Expected Results:
- ✅ App should load without infinite loops
- ✅ Listings should display properly (white page should show content)
- ✅ Tapping on listings should work without freezing
- ✅ Category filtering should work without crashes
- ✅ No more assertion errors about box constraints

### Test Steps:
1. Start the app - should load without infinite console messages
2. Check if listings appear on home page
3. Try tapping a listing - should navigate without freezing
4. Try selecting a category - should filter without crashes
5. Pull to refresh - should work smoothly

### If Issues Persist:
- Check console for any remaining error messages
- Check if Supabase connection is working
- Verify that listings exist in the database
